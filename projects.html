								<h2>MyCaddie</h2>
								<p>During the summer of 2017 I worked with my good friend <a href="https://kliao2016.github.io" target="kliao"> Kevin Liao</a> on our first IOS app. Neither of us had any experience with app building, but we decided to give it our best shot. We have finished the app and it will be uploaded to the app store by January 1st, 2018.</p>

<p>The app uses a Firebase database to keep user data on the cloud. It was programmed in Xcode using the language Swift. Design work for the app was done using Sketch. The repository of the app can be found on Github.</p>

<p>Check out the app's website: <a href="https://wmauz677.github.io/MyCaddieWeb/" target="wmauz"> MyCaddie Website</a></p>

<p>Here is the repository on Github: <a href="https://github.com/kliao2016/MyCaddie" target="wmauz"> MyCaddie Repository</a></p>

								<h2>Chroma Temple</h2>
								<p> I participated in a Game Jam at USC in the Fall of 2017 with absolutely no knowledge of game development or Unity. Over the course of 24 hours, I worked with five others who had limited knowledge of game development, but we managed to produce a basic 2D roguelike game called "Chroma Temple".</p>

								<p> The theme of the Jam was "Color", so we decided to make a game where you were placed in a black and white world where you had to collect 3 elements/color and restore them to the world. </p>

								<p> Overall, the game was not very good, but I am happy with how our group of inexperienced game developers were able to produce a functioning game in 24 hours. </p>

								<h2>Gaming Glove</h2>
								<p>During the Spring semester of 2016, I made a video-gaming glove with my partner for the class, John Hickey. Our task was to create something using Matlab, Arduino, and four sensors.</p>

								<p>The Arduino Uno was loaded with our code from Matlab that utilized a customized library in order to communicate with the serial monitor. From here we were able to create games on-board the glove, along with games it could interact with on the computer.</p>

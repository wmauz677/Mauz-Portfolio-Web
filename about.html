								<h3>Who am I?</h3>
								<p>I grew up here in Golden, and I have lived here almost my whole life. For the last three years, I have been pursuing my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and minor in computer science at Colorado School of Mines.</p>

<p>My Fall 2016 semester was spent in Madrid, Spain, where I attended University of Comillas ICAI. I spent the four months gaining a more in-depth understanding of the language and culture, along with taking a few engineering classes in Spanish.</p>

<p>I am an avid skier, golfer, ultimate frisbee player, and cyclist. I have skied since I was five years old and I raced for 9 years. I have been playing ultimate with the club team at the school for three years. I also really enjoy photography because it has taken me to many beautiful places that I would have never been otherwise.</p>

<p>I've been interested in computer science for the last few years, and I love learning new things I can do with it. I've worked on many personal projects, which you can check out in the "Projects" tab of my website. I've take two C++ courses at the school, and I have taught myself: Swift, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I even coded this website!</p>

<p>I am currently seeking a summer internship where I can apply my knowledge of mechanical engineering and computer science, and I'm excited to see where it will take me.</p>

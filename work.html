							<h2> Wunderman Thompson Mobile </h2>
							<p> Associate Software Developer - August 2019 - May 2020</p>
						</header>

						<p>My interest in iOS development helped guide me to my first full-time position, working for the company formerly known as Possible Mobile, located in Denver, CO. I was assigned to work on the iOS side of development because of my previous iOS experience from my personal projects.</p>

						<p>During my time here, I worked on two different projects - both on the iOS side. I developed on both the frontend and backend of the software. I learned how to use Networking and Core Data while on these projects and gained valuable experience of coding as part of a team.</p>

						<p>The majority of my time here was spent working on bug fixes and working on feature teams. I gained experience working with large code bases and developing on various iOS devices.</p>

							<h2> Callaway Golf </h2>
							<p> Operations Intern - Summer 2018</p>
						</header>

						<p>My passion for golf led me to this internship in Carlsbad, CA at the Callaway Golf Company headquarters.</p>

						<p>At this job, I worked with program managers to optimize the completion of various club programs. I also helped with the logistics of global golf ball distribution.</p>

						<p>I was able to travel to the assembly facility and distribution center to gain a stronger understanding of the supply chain.</p>

							<h2> Traylor Brothers - Underground </h2>
							<p> Heading Engineer Intern - Fall 2017</p>
						</header>

						<p>My previous mining experience in addition to my admiration of heavy machinery put me on the Regional Connector Project in Los Angeles. This is a $1.7 Billion Metro project that is adding new connections to the existing metro system in downtown L.A.</p>

						<p>This is a joint venture between Traylor Brothers and Skanska called "Regional Connector Constructors." We used an EPB Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) to dig 1-mile twin tunnels along the route. Thre metro stations are currently being built along this new route. </p>

						<p>I spent my shifts in the heading of the TBM performing quality control, ring senquencing, and routine maintenance of the machine. When the machine was not running, I was helping the lead engineer with drafting and site optimization.</p>

							<h2> Kiewit Mining Group </h2>
							<p> Mining Engineer Intern - Summer 2015</p>
						</header>

						<p>My interests in mining landed me my first internship - located in Soda Springs, Idaho - on an open pit phosphate mine.</p>

						<p>During the first month and a half of the internship I worked with the maintenance crew in order to achieve a better understanding of the impact of the engineer's job on the mine.</p>

						<p>For the remainder of the internship, I coordinated mine activities with maintenance planners and managers. I used SAP & Excel to monitor & schedule maintenance, parts deliveries, and repairs on heavy machinery.</p>
